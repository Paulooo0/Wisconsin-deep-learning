# Wisconsin-deep-learning

A neural network model created using tensorflow, that has 94% of accuracy. The model has 30 neurons in the first layer, 10 in second layer and 1 in last layer.

## What was done?
In the actual stage, we have the `neural network model`, the `API` was created using `Flask`, a `HTML template` and the `analysis of the dataset`.

## What should be done next?
Write the `CSS` for the template and a `classifier algorith` to predict the result in 2 possibilities (yes/no) in the `HTML`.
